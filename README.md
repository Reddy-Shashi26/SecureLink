## Link Encryption & Decryption Web App

A simple and professional web-based application to encrypt links with a password and decrypt them securely. This project ensures sensitive links can only be accessed by those with the correct password.

### Features
- **Encrypt Links:** Generate an encrypted link secured by a password.
- **Password-Protected Decryption:** Users must enter the correct password to access the original link.
- **Modern Design:** A sleek, responsive UI built with CSS.
- **Client-Side Implementation:** Entirely JavaScript-based for quick and efficient encryption/decryption.
